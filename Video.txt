# Structure : 
-  when naming make name of classes you create like dto, model,.. Single , also make name of model & repo files single , rest of files make it plural ,
   see mongo in nest docs , typegoose , https://github.dev/angular-university/nestjs-course/tree/master/rest-api/src , 'no specific way to do that',
 
- Note to reason of : rename paramsOrQueryWithId to paramsWithId , also make attributes required not optional $change in master$

- explain base.repository.ts 

- explain BaseModel usage with limitations (no read toJson(),also must put @schema in child)

- id,createdAt,updatedAt in schema not important => its only for swagger 

- refer to lesson schema with optional attributes

- note to startSolution in exams.service when return nothing , and explain if you remove return , then you throw error it will works incorrectly

    in case of fetchAll then add file filterQueryOptions in dto folder
